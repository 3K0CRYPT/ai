# Gaming AI Libraries/Middleware

Referenced for completeness, these can’t really be tested by single developers or used outside their intended game environments.

There’s a few of them that seem to be provider by subsidiaries of bigger companies (European, mostly).

Some of these companies have websites that seem plucked out of the 1990’s. 

Blurbs on each one are extracted from their webpages.

## VT-Systems
http://www.vt-systems.com/
* This is a weird one, they are “VT Systems, a company of ST Engineering” and then they have seemingly dozens of products. It’s hard to follow who they are or what they sell. 
http://www.mak.com/
Then there’s “VT MAK” which in turn is “a company of VT systems” (!)
