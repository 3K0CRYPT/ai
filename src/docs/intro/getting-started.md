# The A16Z AI Survey

The introduction of the iPhone ten years ago was the final spark needed to set off the mobile revolution. Today, we are seeing emerging trends that coalesce into new paths for technology that will help define the decade that follows. We find ourselves in the midst of an unprecedented wave of hardware innovation and the continued growth of cloud computing and mobile we are faced with a demand for new approaches to analyze, classify, and react to the data that we can now capture, store, and process.

Recent years have seen an explosion of “big data,” a helpful moniker for what is in essence data-driven (as opposed to “instinct-driven”) analysis, processes, and even design. The big data revolution isn’t over: it’s barely begun. A lot of the work done so far has involved primarily the development of basic capabilities necessary to process data at scales that were simply not achievable before. Tens of billions of dollars and millions of people-hours have been spent building both the software capabilities and infrastructure necessary to track, process, store, organize, analyze and query the amounts of data that before might not have been collected, much less stored for processing.

For a while, simple rule-based systems or complex layers of software behavior were enough to extract the low hanging fruit out of these new, vast sources of potential information. For example, consider the cornerstone of Facebook and many other services: “the feed”. Originally it simply was an _activity_ feed, a barely-filtered aggregation of literal activity: new posts, new photos, new comments. As data, both human- and machine-generated exploded, simple aggregation gave way to more complex algorithms and processing that mixes personal events, global events and news, intimate thoughts and photos, and advertisement.

Today we are long past the point at which any single human being could effectively understand or work with the data generated, and while there’s always human influence and intervention in what services present to us on a daily basis, much of the process of selection and “curation” is now effectively out of human hands. Software that calls itself 'smart' is giving way to software that actually is.

The same technological environment that has created the demand for intelligent systems has also provided us with the tools and systems necessary to push Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning forward. This has meant rapid innovation, but also a gap in knowledge and understanding at a general level of what these technologies are and what they can (and can’t) do.

## Why a survey?

There is something different about this particular wave of innovation that sets it apart from others: new _commercial_ services of many different levels of abstraction and complexity have appeared seemingly overnight.

In particular, large organizations and corporations, instead of small fast-moving startups have been frequently at the forefront of the field. New services have been released at an accelerated pace, owing in part to the fact that much of what’s “new” about AI/ML in recent years has to do as much with quantitative jumps in scale and speed as with advanced in fundamental science. Significant research and applications which for years grew quietly within both labs and garages have become both possible and necessary at roughly the same time.

This has resulted in a situation where the public at large, as well as people in technology that are not directly involved in the field, have seen complete systems “appear” out of nowhere. News stories, blog posts, books, articles, all point to step-function advancements that seem to have come without any precedent.

In this context, it was our goal to create a source of information that would be useful as an introduction to the field in general, using actual services and systems available today as examples of how this technology can be leveraged across different environments. A combination that we hope can serve readers as a first step, and a guide, to delve more deeply into topics or interest or systems and services that can be relevant beyond what their creators imagined.
